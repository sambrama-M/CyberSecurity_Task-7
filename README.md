# Task 7: Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

## Objective
The goal of this task is to understand how to identify and remove potentially harmful browser extensions to maintain online safety and browser performance.

## Tools Used
- Web Browser (Google Chrome or Firefox)

## Steps to Identify Suspicious Extensions

1. Open **Google Chrome** on your computer.
2. Click the menu icon (three vertical dots) at the top-right corner and select **Extensions > Manage Extensions**.
3. Review the list of installed extensions and look for any that:
   - You do not recognize or remember installing.
   - Have poor reviews or unknown developers.
   - Ask for unnecessary permissions.
4. Select **Details > More** for any suspicious extension.
5. Click **Remove** if it's not required or seems unsafe.
6. Optionally, search for trusted alternatives on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore).

## Impact of Suspicious Extensions

Using untrusted or malicious extensions can lead to:

1. **Privacy Breaches**  
   Extensions may monitor your browsing activity, including visited websites, search queries, and personal information.

2. **Data Theft**  
   Some extensions can capture sensitive data such as passwords, payment details, and form inputs.

3. **Unwanted Content and Redirects**  
   Ad-injecting or redirecting extensions may alter web pages and direct you to phishing or malicious websites.

4. **Browser Performance Issues**  
   Excessive memory or CPU usage may result in slower performance, crashes, or freezing.

5. **Malware Distribution**  
   Certain extensions may serve as entry points for spyware, ransomware, or other malicious software.

6. **Unauthorized Access to Accounts**  
   If given broad permissions, extensions can manipulate sessions, send data, or post content without user consent.

## Best Practices for Safety

- Install extensions only from reputable sources.
- Always review permissions before installing.
- Regularly audit and remove unused or unfamiliar extensions.
- Use trusted antivirus and browser security settings to monitor extension behavior.
