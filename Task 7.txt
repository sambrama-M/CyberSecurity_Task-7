1. Privacy Breaches:
                   Malicious extensions can monitor your browsing activity, including search queries, websites visited, and online behavior. Some may also access and exfiltrate sensitive information such as login credentials, emails, and form inputs.

2. Data Theft:
             Extensions with broad permissions may intercept sensitive data, including usernames, passwords, payment information, and other confidential details. This data can be misused or sold on the dark web.

3. Unwanted Content and Redirects:
                                 Some extensions inject advertisements, pop-ups, or banners into websites. Others may redirect you to phishing or malicious sites, often impersonating legitimate pages to steal information.

4. Performance Degradation:
                          Suspicious extensions may consume excessive system resources, leading to slower browser performance, frequent crashes, or freezes. This can significantly affect productivity and user experience.

5. Malware Delivery:
                    Certain extensions can act as a vector for delivering malware, such as spyware, ransomware, or keyloggers. These threats can compromise your system, data, and network security.

6. Unauthorized Account Access:
                              If an extension gains access to browser sessions, it can impersonate the user and perform unauthorized actions, including sending messages, posting content, or altering settings within web applications.
